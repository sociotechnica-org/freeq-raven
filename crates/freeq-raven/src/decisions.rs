//! Decision log — extracts commitment language from speech and
//! accumulates structured `Decision` records so a session-end
//! read-back surfaces "things this room decided" without anyone
//! taking notes. Live demo of *conversation as the source of
//! knowledge work*: nobody types decisions, they just say them.
//!
//! Extraction is intentionally simple + deterministic so the
//! functional core is unit-testable. The patterns catch the
//! highest-signal commitment language ("let's X", "we should X",
//! "I'll X", "by [date] we'll X"); an LLM enrichment pass is a
//! reasonable future addition that wraps the deterministic core
//! rather than replaces it.

/// One captured commitment.
