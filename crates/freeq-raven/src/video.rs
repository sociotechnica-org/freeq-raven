//! Raven's video tile.
//!
//! The tile is a live, animated surface — never a black square. When
//! Raven has nothing to show it renders a **state-aware presence** (an
//! orb that visibly idles, listens, thinks, or speaks). When it answers
//! a question it renders a **designed scene card**: the model picks a
//! layout — hero, key points, a big stat, a quote, or a timeline — and
//! the renderer draws it with typographic hierarchy, depth and motion.
//!
//! Everything is drawn as SVG, re-rendered every frame (so it genuinely
//! animates), rasterized with resvg, and fed to the H.264 encoder. The
//! tile is a plain video stream, so every client just plays it.
