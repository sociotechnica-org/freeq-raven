//! [`AvSession`] — the MoQ transport layer for a freeq AV agent.
//!
//! A freeq voice/video call rides MoQ (Media over QUIC). Every
//! participant publishes one *broadcast* (their mic + camera) to a
//! shared SFU; everyone else subscribes to it. [`AvSession`] packages
//! both halves so an agent doesn't re-derive the plumbing:
//!
//! - **Publish** — connect to the SFU and publish the agent's own
//!   broadcast: an Opus audio track fed by a [`PushAudioSource`] (so the
//!   agent can speak) plus an H.264 video track fed by a caller-supplied
//!   [`VideoSource`].
//! - **Subscribe** — watch the SFU's announce stream and, for every
//!   *other* participant in the same session, subscribe to their audio,
//!   decode it, and surface a stream of [`PcmFrame`]s.
//!
//! The MoQ transport drops occasionally (network blips, SFU restarts).
//! [`AvSession`] reconnects automatically with backoff; a reconnect ends
//! every participant's PCM stream and re-announces them fresh.
//!
